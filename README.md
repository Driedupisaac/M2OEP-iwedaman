*Hello. My project was monopoly. This module, I believe I progressed considerably with the background workings of the game of monopoly. I faced trouble with how certain aspects of the game related to each other and how to adequately represent that. I've found that inheritance has been a vital tool for showing, for example, how, though a tax square and a property square are not the same thing, they both have the common attribute of being a square on the board, and inherit similar characteristics from which to branch off of. 

*My program consists of asking the user to either start a new game or load a saved game, then, if they chose to start a new game, to ask them how many are playing, and their names, and then to start the main gameplay loop of having a menu of options to choose from, from which they can roll, see their assets, and save their profiles in a file for future reception. Had they chosen to load a game, they would be prompted to enter a file with info, which is read in (i'm still figuring out how to standardize all constructors). There are no known bugs as far as I see it

*I intend to complete the basic core game loop of buying properties and charging rent, and I want to streamline saving and loading files. I think that I have constructed the perfect base of hierarchies and inheritances from which to branch off, and need only to code in the transferral of property to your portfolio and losing money (which I started with the tax - it) - I can rent with the same inherited function. 

*I think I merited the full 40 points for the sheer amount of code programs (at least in my eyes!) I think I did a 40-point-job when it came to creating and connecting the different files to represent different areas of monopoly, and I think my program is a little more complicated than the guided projects. I also believe I did a good job validating user input, and making my program interactive. 

*I didn't include a testing program

*I think i merited 40 points for the use of inheritance, including is-a and has-a relationships. My reasoning is that all the Assets and their hierarchy merits 20 points for it's robust design and vital role in the main program, same with the square class. (both represent the properties and squares of the game). Whats more, I think I merited 40 points for utilizing has-a relationships, for example by having many classes reference others, and use other classes' methods in their own to change global variables. For example, the Board class initializes a vector of the class square, which is either a property or a tax. the game class initializes a vector of players, whose attributes are modified and altered to fit the needs of the game by methods found in all mentioned classes. I believe that my program exhibits the usability and benefit to using inheritance and both is-a and has a relationships. 

*I believe that I merited 10 points for my utilization of file input and output, with validated input. 

*I believe that I should lose a total of 5 points, mainly for my sporadic editing of my project. I could have added and contributed with a lot more discipline, and my lack of time management put an unnecessary ceiling on the growth of this project. From there, however, I honestly believe that my program is clearly organized, with robust comments to aid in the understanding of my classes and their methods, and that my video shows some samp[le demo runs of my program.
